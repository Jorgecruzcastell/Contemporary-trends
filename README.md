# Contemporary-trends
When we talk about measuring witch one is more real, online or offline reality, we get to an impasse, we are used to think that the existence of one fights with the other, and by ourselves create conflicts. We see these concepts as opposites, but if we try to have a bigger picture we can realize that one makes the other better, and that in fact they don´t necessarily try to have everything for itself. It is necessary to make a deeper analysis, taking into account that the idea of one replacing the other would lead to the lack of context for the contemporary history.
Many times it’s been said “ Internet it’s going to kill printed media” but maybe according to facts we could get into the idea of “ Internet it’s going to help printed media”, as time is passing we are witnessing the evolution of both realities, films like trascender had shown in an hypothetical scenario the mistakes it could lead us to try to live in an online world, the main difficulty would be, we could loose our feet on our way to progress, and take things over our acknowledgment.
