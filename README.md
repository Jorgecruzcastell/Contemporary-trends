# Contemporary-trends
When we talk about measuring witch one is more real, online or offline reality, we get to an impasse, we are used to think that the existence of one fights with the other, and by ourselves create conflicts. We see these concepts as opposites, but if we try to have a bigger picture we can realize that one makes the other better, and that in fact they donÂ´t necessarily try to have everything for itself. It is necessary to make a deeper analysis, taking into account that the idea of one replacing the other would lead to the lack of context for the contemporary history.
